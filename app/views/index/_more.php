    <p>
        Unlike most video sharing sites, Unda aims to garner as many viewers as possible for content
        creators without the need of third-party social media sites. A newly published video will
        recieve a minimum of 5,000 views within the first 24 hours, with the goal of boosting your
        channel.

        Unda focuses on sharing newly uploaded videos rather than soley supporting a popularity
        contest because we believe everyone deserves a chance. Upon upload your video will be placed through a
        newsfeed with all other videos for 24 hours. Your video will remain in this newsfeed for at most 24 hours,
        or until it reaches 5000 views. The view cap is extended by 5 views for every like it recieves in the 24
        hour time frame.

        Simply put if your video recieves no likes the max number of views in the newsfeed will be 5000, but 6000 views if
        it recieves 200 likes. Once your video reaches its view or time limit, it will be removed from the feed for other videos.
