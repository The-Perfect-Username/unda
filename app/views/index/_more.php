    <p>
        Unlike most video sharing sites, Unda aims to garner as many viewers as possible for content
        creators without the need of third-party social media sites. A newly published video will
        recieve a minimum of 5,000 views within the first 24 hours, with the goal of boosting your
        channel.

        How you ask? Unda focuses on sharing newly uploaded videos rather than soley supporting a popularity
        contest because we believe everyone deserves a chance. Unda gives newly published videos a boost
        without saturising the newsfeed and preventing other videos from being seen.
