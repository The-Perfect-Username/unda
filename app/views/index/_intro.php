    <p>Unda is an online video sharing site that maintains focus on gaining exposure for videos.</p>
    <p>
        Unlike most video sharing sites, Unda aims to garner as many viewers as possible for content
        creators without the need of third-party social media sites. A newly published video will
        recieve a minimum of 5,000 views within the first 24 hours, with the goal of boosting your
        channel.
